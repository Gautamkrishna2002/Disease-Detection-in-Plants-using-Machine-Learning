# Plant-Disease-Detection

Plant Disease Detection is a deep learning project aimed at helping farmers detect diseases in plants using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project uses Pytorch framework for building the CNN model and classifying leaf images into 8 different categories. The dataset used for training the model is the Plant Village dataset.
