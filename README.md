# Plant-Disease-Detection

Plant Disease Detection is a deep learning project aimed at helping farmers detect diseases in plants using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project uses Pytorch framework for building the CNN model and classifying leaf images into 8 different categories. The dataset used for training the model is the Plant Village dataset, and you can find the dataset link in the blog section.

## Contribution (Open Source)

This project is now open source, and developers interested in contributing can do so in the following ways:

- Improve the User Interface (UI).
- Enhance the deep learning model to make it more powerful and accurate.
- Add informative markdown files in specific sections.
- Ensure that any changes to the deep learning model are well-documented by uploading updated markdown files (.md), PDFs, and Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) in their respective sections.
- Thoroughly test the code to ensure there are no errors or issues.
- To contribute, fork this project, make the necessary changes, and then create a pull request after successful testing.

## Testing Images

If you don't have leaf images for testing, you can use the test images located in the "test_images" folder. Each image in this folder is labeled with its corresponding disease name, allowing you to verify the model's performance.


Feel free to explore the app and test the plant disease detection capabilities using the provided test images. If you encounter any issues or have ideas for improvements, don't hesitate to contribute to the project! Together, we can make plant disease detection more accessible and reliable for farmers.
